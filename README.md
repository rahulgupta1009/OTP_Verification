# OTP_Verification
We have created an application for the task of OTP verification using Python.
We have used tkinter and smtplib module to develop OTP Verification GUI. 

The steps are mentioned below:

1.First, create a 6-digit random number.

2.Then store the number in a variable
3.Then we need to write a program to send emails.

4. When sending email, we need to use OTP as a message.
5. Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for
the userâ€™s email and then for the OTP that the user has received.
